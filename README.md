# Cancerous-Tumor-Classifier-based-on-gene-expressions
Cancerous Tumor Classifier based on RNA-Seq gene expressions dataset

It uses the 'gene expression cancer RNA-Seq Data Set' available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq to create classification models using six different algorithms - 
Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis
K-Nearest Neighbors
Classification and Regression Trees
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines

It then compares the performace of those models by using K-Fold cross-validation.
